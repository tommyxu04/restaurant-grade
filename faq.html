                <h3> Why does the Health Department inspect restaurants?  </h3>
                <p>
                    The Health Department inspects the approximately 27,000 restaurants in New York City to monitor their compliance with food safety regulations. 
                    Inspectors observe how food is prepared, served and stored and whether restaurant workers are practicing good hygiene. 
                    They check food temperatures, equipment maintenance and pest control measures.

                <h3> How often are restaurants supposed to be graded? </h3>
                <p>
                    Restaurants are inspected on a risk based schedule that can range between one and four times per year. 
                    Almost all establishments get at least two inspections per year. Follow up visits are required for critical item violations.
                </p>

                <h3> How are restaurants graded? </h3>
                <p>
                    Violations found during inspections carry point values, and a restaurant's score corresponds to a letter grade. 
                    The point/grade cut-offs are the same as for mobile food vending letter grading, with fewer points corresponding to a better grade:
                    <ul>
                        <li> "A" grade: 0 to 13 points for sanitary violations </li>
                        <li> "B" grade: 14 to 27 points for sanitary violations </li>
                        <li> "C" grade: 28 or more points for sanitary violations </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </li>
            <br><li>
                <h3> What is "Grade Pending"? </h3>
                <p>
                    "Grade Pending" means that on both the initial inspection and reinspection, the restaurant received 14 or more points. 
                    Following the reinspection, the restaurant can post "Grade Pending" or the letter grade while they have the opportunity for an administrative hearing to determine the final grade
